    <h1>Reimagining African American Life in The Diamondback, 1967</h1>
    <h2>An introductory encoding project by Aia H. Yousef, Visiting Student, University of Maryland, College Park</h2>
    <div id="description">
      <p> In the article “Venus in Two Acts” (2008), Saidiya Hartman introduces the notion of “critical fabulation”: a method of imagining and writing a cultural history of those who have been historically overlooked or misrepresented by traditional archives, it is characterized by a “double gesture.” It is a method that pushes “against the limits of the archive” at the same time that it “enact[s] the impossibility” of its practice (11). It is a gesture that is at once promoted and undercut by the very rationale of its method. </p>

      <p> I begin with Hartman’s idea of critical fabulation because the two articles I selected from The University of Maryland (UMD), College Park’s campus newspaper, The DiamondBack, for this encoding project are rife with moments that welcome this kind of imagining. These instances, highlighted in red, prompt the reader to imagine everything from a re-presenting of information that might have prioritized different or hidden perspectives to speculations about what might have been narrated had different questions been asked. But, even as we consider “what might have been,” Hartman’s warning that it is impossible—and even irresponsible—to “give voice” to the overlooked or misrepresented haunts this reimagining. Instead, what we should strive for is a narrative that “exploit[s] the capacities of the subjunctive,” as Hartman puts it (12, 11). </p>

      <p> The following, then, is an illustration of the role of critical fabulation, using a moment in an article that appeared in The Diamondback in 1967 as part of a series documenting African American life on UMD’s campus. While I emphasize a particular moment in the article “A lonely walk?: Negroes view campus with mixed emotions,” I highlight in red other moments in both “A lonely walk?” and “Militant Negro Speaks” that lend themselves to this kind of play with and against the archival record. </p>

      <p> In “A lonely walk?,” two University of Maryland students report that two white girls, “dressed up in paper bags, [and] pretending they were a (Ku Klux) Klan” sprinkled perfume on the floor of a dorm “in the shape of a cross and set fire to it.” The students report that this had apparently been in response to their plastering “Black Power signs all over their hall.” The article’s author represents the response of the two African American students to the perfume incident in the following manner: </p>

      <p> “‘It really startled us!’ exclaimed Carolyn.  </p>
      <p> ‘We kid around a lot in the dorm,’ related Bronwyn, a junior. ‘We sing ‘We Shall overcome.’’ Songs and jokes, she says, don’t offend her, for she does not ‘look on the bad side about what other people say about me.’” </p>

      <p> It is not altogether clear if Bronwyn is one of the students who relayed the details of the incident. In any event, the author’s choice to follow Carolyn’s response of “It really startled us!” with another that reduces the event to something akin to a prank is a strange one.</p>

      <p> Had the author dwelled on this incident a little longer with the students, providing a brief history of the white supremacist organization, and prompting Carolyn to elaborate more on what precisely she found startling, and why, then it might have been possible to get a fuller and deeper sense of her reaction. One might imagine the feeling of being startled coupled with something like fear, or even terror. To be reminded of a historically violent and racist organization at college, away from family and familiar surroundings, is not typical and certainly difficult, to say the very least. It’s not hard to imagine that Carolyn might have considered transferring from the university after the incident. It’s difficult not to read this part of the article, that is, and wonder about all of the things that might have been said but ignored, left unsaid and merely thought, and/or quietly shared with others in ways that never got officially documented. </p>

      <p> As noted, other moments that lend themselves to this kind of reimagining are highlighted below in red.</p>
